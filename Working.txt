How the Code Works:
Tkinter GUI:

The Tkinter library is used to create a simple user interface where the user can input text or a URL.
The user clicks the "Generate QR Code" button to trigger the QR code generation.
QR Code Generation:

The qrcode library is used to create the QR code.
The QR code is saved as an image file (generated_qr_code.png) in the current directory.
The QR code is also displayed in the default image viewer using img.show().
